    <H2>ABOUT ME</H2>
    <hr>
    <P>I finished my 3-year career a week ago, I quit my job. I made a classic start for a new life and cut my hair. I
        started reading books regularly. I make myself a coffee with milk every day. I have design hours for "ETSY" and
        work hours for "patika". I study English for half an hour a day. I created a nice routine. I will make my life
        better. Promise to myself.</P>
